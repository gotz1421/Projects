# OpenWispr pSEO — architecture & plan

Programmatic SEO for the marketing site, built as a **static-HTML generator**, not a framework.
Output is plain `.html` files checked into `website/` and served by the existing zero-dependency
`server.js` — nothing about the deployed site changes. This doc covers why these page types, how
the generator works, how it adapts the AutoMata/SellBikes.in pSEO playbook to a stack with no
build step, and the quality bar every generated page is held to.

## Why this shape, not something else

The prior pSEO project this borrows from (`~/Documents/Personal/AutoMata/astro-news/docs/ai-seo-handover/`)
runs on Astro with GSC-driven analyzers, an LLM planner, and auto-merging weekly crons. None of
that infrastructure exists here yet — OpenWispr's site has no Search Console history, no
`data/experiments/ledger.jsonl`, no analyzers. Copying the harness wholesale on day zero would be
exactly the failure mode `05-what-doesnt.md` warns about ("empty ledger makes the recency filter
toothless", "don't enable the weekly harness with <60d of GSC data"). So this is deliberately
**Phase 0**: the content-generation half of the playbook (data file → template → static page),
built by hand for the first batch, with the harness/analyzer half stubbed and documented for when
GSC access exists (see the punch list below).

The one lesson taken wholesale from `04-what-works.md` / `05-what-doesnt.md`: **pSEO only earns
its keep when the page answers a query with real demand and a genuine fact difference — not when
it's a template stamped N times.** SellBikes.in's guides averaged ~1 click each; their pSEO city
pages outperformed because the URL template mapped to a *real* per-query slice (brand × city) with
distinct, factual content per cell. OpenWispr has no such combinatorial data set (no per-city
pricing, no per-model specs at scale) — so this plan explicitly rejects mass-templating a fake
grid (e.g. "OpenWispr vs Wispr Flow for {city}" or "{100 professions} dictation app") and instead
ships a **small number of pages, each hand-populated with facts from `research/`**, sized to grow
only as new genuinely-differentiated angles appear.

## Batch 2 — page-volume-first for early weeks (explicit decision log)

After reviewing the first 4 pages, the user made a deliberate strategic call: **for the first few
weeks of a brand-new site, prioritize a larger number of pages** as a crawl-budget / early-indexing
strategy — get more of the site's genuinely defensible surface area in front of Google sooner,
rather than drip-feeding one page at a time as GSC data trickles in. This is accepted as a real
strategic tradeoff, not a reversal of the spam-policy discipline above: **the "no fake grid" rule
from Batch 1 still holds completely.** What changed is the *pace* of building out genuine breadth
that already existed in `research/` but hadn't been written up yet — not the standard for what
counts as a genuine page.

Concretely, Batch 2 adds 9 more comparison pages and 3 more long-tail/use-case pages — 12 new
pages, all individually cleared through the same checklist in "Spam-policy / quality bar" below,
none template-stamped. The primary-source thread (`research/01-primary-source.md`) that started
this whole research effort names 14 alternatives; the five multi-mention products (FluidVoice,
Handy, Amical, Muesli, Spokenly) are real, demand-validated peers, not a list assembled to hit a
page count. Every one of the 9 new comparisons is justified individually in "Comparison pages,
batch 2" below with the specific research doc + fact backing it. The accepted tradeoff, stated
plainly: **more maintenance surface** — 11 comparison pages and 5 long-tail pages now need
re-verification whenever a competitor's pricing or feature set changes, not 2 and 2. That cost is
accepted in exchange for indexing more of the site's real, sourced content sooner.

## Batch 4 — "Wispr Flow alternative" bottom-funnel pages (one-page-vs-two-page decision log)

The user asked to target two distinct keyword shapes: **"wispr flow alternative"** (general) and
**"wisprflow alternative for android" / "wispr flow alternative android"**. Both are bottom-of-funnel
"I already decided I want to leave/avoid Wispr Flow" searches, distinct from the existing
head-to-head `/compare/wispr-flow.html` comparison page's more neutral "how do these two products
differ" framing — but the two keyword shapes needed separate judgment calls against each other.

**General query ("wispr flow alternative") → optimized the existing page, did not fork it.**
`/compare/wispr-flow.html` already *is* the honest, sourced answer to "is there a good Wispr Flow
alternative" — a second page making essentially the same architecture/pricing/privacy argument
with different headlines would be exactly the near-duplicate-content risk this README's own
quality bar (#2, "not a template stamp") warns against, just aimed at ourselves instead of at a
competitor-name list. Instead, `data/compare-wispr-flow.json` was edited in place: `title`,
`ogTitle`, `h1`, `description`, and `subhead` now carry "alternative" phrasing naturally
("A Free, On-Device Wispr Flow Alternative"), the intro paragraph gained an explicit
independent/unaffiliated sentence (see fair-use section below), a new FAQ entry
("What's a good free, open-source alternative to Wispr Flow?") answers the query shape directly,
and a new `relatedLinks` entry points to the Android-specific page. No new URL, no duplicate
content, one canonical page still owns this intent — consistent with quality-bar rule #4 ("one
canonical URL per topic").

**Android query ("wisprflow alternative for android") → built as a new, genuinely distinct page,**
`/compare/wispr-flow-alternative-android.html`. This clears the "not a template stamp" bar because
the research supports a materially different, Android-specific argument that the general page
doesn't make in depth:
- **Wispr Flow does ship on Android** (`research/02-competitors-desktop.md`'s comparison table:
  Android ✅) — running the identical cloud-only backend as desktop. This page corrects a
  plausible assumption (that Android is a newer/limited gap for Wispr Flow, the way it is for
  superwhisper/Spokenly/VoiceInk) rather than asserting it, because the research doesn't support
  that framing for Wispr Flow specifically.
- **A large, sourced platform-specific reputation gap**: Wispr Flow's own Google Play data shows
  3.69/5 from 3,128 ratings (16.6% one-star lifetime, 27.8% among its 400 newest reviews) versus
  4.8/5 on iOS for "the same product, same backend" (`research/04-pain-points.md` #5, "Android is
  the weak flank by a wide margin"). This is a genuinely Android-specific fact with no equivalent
  on the general comparison page.
- **A self-disclosed, pre-announced free-tier tightening specific to Android**: Wispr Flow's own
  pricing page flags its Android free tier as "Unlimited (limited time only)"
  (`research/04-pain-points.md` #7, "the best-timed Android wedge available" per the research's
  own framing). The general page's comparison table mentions this fact in one row; this page
  builds an entire section and FAQ around it because it's specifically an Android-buyer's
  consideration, not a general one.
- **An Android-specific historical reliability bug**: audio from failed Android transcriptions
  wasn't preserved until Wispr Flow's March 2026 v1.4.1 update (`research/02-competitors-desktop.md`'s
  changelog table) — a dated fact about the Android build specifically, not the desktop product.
- **OpenWispr's own Android app is a first-class target, not a port** — matching the task's framing
  that this may be a sharper Android-specific differentiator. This is stated honestly, not oversold:
  the page's own "Honest gaps" section admits OpenWispr's Android app has no meaningful Play Store
  review history yet, against Wispr Flow's 3,128 ratings (however mixed) — sourced from
  `research/07-recommendations.md` ("0 reviews is a larger conversion drag than any keyword").

This is the "one strong page vs. two thin pages" judgment call the task asked to make explicitly:
the general query got an *optimization*, not a new page, because forking it would have been
keyword-stuffing dressed up as coverage; the Android query got a *new* page because the research
genuinely supports an argument the general page doesn't make.

**Model claim discipline, since this batch touches Android specifics directly:** the new page
describes OpenWispr's Android on-device model as "an on-device Whisper-class speech model,"
matching what `data/android-on-device-whisper-dictation.json` (Batch 1) already states about the
current shipped model (~488 MB Whisper small) — it does **not** claim Parakeet for Android, even
though `llms.txt` and recent commits (`a8ff738`, experimental Parakeet vocab-bias decoding) show
Parakeet work is landing. Without a research doc or shipped-feature confirmation that Parakeet is
Android's *default* today, claiming it here would repeat the exact "invent a fact not in
`research/`" mistake this pipeline's quality bar exists to prevent. Revisit this page's model
claim once Parakeet is confirmed as Android's shipped default.

**Trademark/fair-use stance for this batch:** both pages state early and plainly that OpenWispr is
independent and unaffiliated with Wispr Flow — not defensively, but as a natural extension of the
site's existing "MIT, no venture positioning" tone. Neither page uses Wispr Flow's logo, visual
branding, or color scheme (both reuse the same neutral text-only competitor-name treatment already
used across every comparison page in this pipeline). Neither page implies partnership or
endorsement. Every fact about Wispr Flow traces to `research/02-competitors-desktop.md` or
`research/04-pain-points.md` — no new claims about Wispr Flow were invented beyond what those two
docs (already used for the Batch 1 comparison page) establish. The framing throughout is "here's
the sourced comparison for people who already want to leave/avoid Wispr Flow," including admitting
OpenWispr's own gaps (younger Android app, no review history, retry-on-failure still in progress)
— not a page built to capture or confuse Wispr Flow's own branded search traffic.

## Batch 6 — the `/docs/` section (a different job from every other page here)

Nine documentation pages under `/docs/`, plus a `docs` page type in `build.mjs` and four
components in `render.mjs`. This batch is structurally unlike Batches 1-5 and the difference is
worth stating, because the quality bar below was written for pages that argue a position at a
search query, and these do not.

**The evidence standard is different, and stricter.** Every other page type on this site sources
its claims to `research/*.md` — competitor docs, changelogs, organic discussion. A docs page has
no such source: its subject is our own app, so the only admissible evidence is the code that
implements it. Every number on these nine pages (a threshold in milliseconds, a model size, a
default, a retry schedule) was read out of `android/app/src/main/java/com/voicerewriter/` or
`macos/App/Sources/` before it was written down. Nothing was taken from the app's own marketing
copy, from `README.md`, or from the existing pages on this site — several of which turned out to
be approximations once the source was checked.

**Structure taken from an information architecture, not from prose.** The starting point was
Handy's docs (12 pages: about, advanced, cli, debug, faq, general, history, models,
paste-methods, post-processing, troubleshooting). Deliberately not copied page-for-page:

- **No CLI page** — we do not have one.
- **No standalone FAQ page** — `faqSectionHtml()` already puts a FAQ block plus `FAQPage`
  structured data at the bottom of every generated page, so the questions live on the page that
  owns the subject. A separate FAQ page would duplicate them and compete with those pages.
- **No `history` page** — a changelog belongs in the repo, where it is already maintained, and a
  hand-copied one on the site would drift by the second release.
- **Two getting-started pages, not one.** Android and macOS diverge on almost everything a new
  user touches: trigger, permissions, install path, even the speech engine list. One merged page
  would be two pages with a toggle.
- **"Paste methods" became "Text insertion and permissions."** Their framing is a desktop one
  (which paste mechanism to use); ours is Android's — an accessibility service, an insertion
  chain with two fallbacks, and the permission that gates it.
- **"Models" became "Models and device fit."** `DeviceFit.kt` is a genuinely differentiating
  story with exact thresholds behind it, and it is the page's centre of gravity rather than a
  footnote to a model table.

**Two new fields on a section (`bullets`, `table`), mirrored in `markdown.mjs`.** The settings
reference and the model catalogue are tabular facts. Flattening them into `paragraphs` would
make them longer, harder to check against the app, and worse in the `.md` mirror than in the
HTML — so both renderers grew the same two optional fields rather than the docs pages growing a
prose workaround.

**The sidebar is derived from the data files, not hand-listed.** `docsNav()` in `build.mjs`
filters `type === "docs"` and sorts on `navOrder`, so a new docs page joins the nav of every
other docs page the moment its data file exists. This is the internal-linking rule in the
quality bar made mechanical instead of remembered.

**Declined for lack of evidence in the source — named so nothing is silently assumed:**
- **Language coverage per model.** The only language statement anywhere in the Android source is
  a code comment calling the Whisper registry "multilingual"; there is no language claim for
  Parakeet or the cleanup models, no locale parameter passed to any engine, and no per-model
  language metadata consumed anywhere. The models page says exactly that and points readers at
  the upstream model cards. Asserting "Parakeet is English-only" — true upstream — would have
  been sourcing a claim about our app to someone else's model card.
- **A latency or accuracy claim beyond the one the code states.** `ParakeetModelManager`'s KDoc
  records ~238ms p50 / ~491ms p95 on an S25 and prose WER below whisper-small. That is quoted as
  the project's own single-device measurement, explicitly labelled as such, and nothing further
  is extrapolated from it.
- **What "Anti-AI phrasing" does on-device.** It does nothing on-device: `buildSystemPrompt` (the
  only consumer of `settings.antiAI`) is the cloud path, and `LocalLlmEngine` uses
  `buildLocalSystemPrompt` or the fine-tune prompt instead. Same for `Creativity`/`temperature`.
  Both are documented as cloud-only, which is the opposite of the obvious assumption — a good
  illustration of why this batch read the call sites rather than the settings screen.
- **A macOS settings reference.** The Mac app's settings were spot-checked, not exhaustively
  read, so its settings live as a section inside the macOS getting-started page rather than as a
  reference page making a completeness claim this pass cannot back.

**Honest divergences documented rather than smoothed over**, because a docs page that hides them
is worse than no page: macOS never passes code context into the cleanup chain (so it capitalises
in a terminal where Android does not); macOS lacks Android's four polish-skip conditions; macOS
uses the English-only `.en` Whisper builds where Android uses the multilingual ones; API keys are
stored in plaintext DataStore on Android; and `ModelDownloader` has no application-level retry
loop at all, only resume-on-next-attempt.

## Page types chosen, and why

### 1. Comparison pages (`/compare/{slug}.html`)

`OpenWispr vs Wispr Flow`, `OpenWispr vs superwhisper`. These target head-to-head competitor
queries, which the pain-point research (`research/04-pain-points.md`) shows have real organic
demand — the HN/Reddit threads cited there ("Free alternative to Wispr Flow…", "local-first
dictation you can trust") get 100s of points specifically on the free/open-source framing, not
privacy. A comparison page is the natural landing spot for that search intent.

Chose **Wispr Flow** and **superwhisper** for the first two, not the full competitor set in
`research/`, because:
- Both are the best-documented competitors in `research/02-competitors-desktop.md` — every claim
  used is sourced to a dated primary source (their own docs, changelog, status page), not an
  "unverified" flag.
- **Deliberately excluded: OpenWhispr** (`research/03-competitors-indie.md` "Brand risk 1"). One
  extra silent letter, same MIT license, same positioning, a funded competitor with 10x the
  stars. A comparison page against a name this close to our own would confuse search results
  (readers landing on `/compare/openwhispr` genuinely unsure which product they're on) and reads
  as bad faith. Not worth the ambiguity for the traffic.
  - Also excluded initially: Amical, because their Android on-device-vs-cloud architecture was
    flagged "unverified" in research. **Re-checked for Batch 2** against
    `research/08-open-questions.md` #3 — still genuinely unresolved (would need an APK teardown or
    a direct statement from Amical), so Batch 2's Amical page does not resolve the question by
    fiat. Instead it builds the comparison **around** the open question: every other fact about
    Amical (MIT license, platform status, context-aware formatting, stars) is sourced normally, and
    the on-device claim is explicitly hedged as "undisclosed," with an explicit note that this page
    does not claim OpenWispr is "the only" on-device Android option because of it. That is a
    materially different move from asserting Amical is cloud-based, which the research does not
    support either.

### Comparison pages, batch 2 (9 new)

Justified individually, each against the specific research fact set that clears the quality bar
below. All nine appear in `research/01-primary-source.md`'s "Alternatives named" table (the
primary-source LinkedIn thread), which is independent evidence of real organic demand for each,
not a list assembled to hit a page count:

- **Spokenly** (`compare/spokenly.html`) — `research/02-competitors-desktop.md`: broadest
  desktop+iOS platform coverage, free-forever local models, an explicit "Local Only Mode" hard
  privacy switch, and an explicit vendor statement about *why* they aren't open source. No Android.
- **VoiceInk** (`compare/voiceink.html`) — `research/02-competitors-desktop.md`: "the closest
  analogue to OpenWispr" per the research itself, GPL-3.0, whisper.cpp/Parakeet on-device, and
  documented as "the best failure-recovery UX found anywhere" in this research — a real gap
  OpenWispr doesn't hide. Apple Silicon only, one-time paid unlock.
- **Handy** (`compare/handy.html`) — `research/03-competitors-indie.md`: the volume leader
  (27,709 ★), MIT, 100% local at every tier, explicitly accessibility-positioned — and, per the
  same doc, "no mobile app at all," which is the clean, honest differentiator this page is built
  around.
- **FluidVoice** (`compare/fluidvoice.html`) — `research/03-competitors-indie.md`: the
  most-mentioned alternative in the primary-source thread (3 mentions), a genuinely novel
  custom-trained local cleanup model (Fluid-1), relicensed Apache-2.0→GPL-3.0 in Feb 2026. macOS
  15+ only, no Android shipped or waitlisted.
- **FreeFlow** (`compare/freeflow.html`) — `research/03-competitors-indie.md`: MIT, but the
  research's own README grep found it defaults to a cloud backend (Groq), not local — a real,
  sourced architectural contrast with OpenWispr's no-cloud-path stance, stated honestly rather than
  used to imply FreeFlow is dishonest (their own docs disclose the tradeoff too).
- **Muesli** (`compare/muesli.html`) — `research/03-competitors-indie.md`: local meeting
  transcription bundled with dictation, and "the clearest [model table] in the field" per the
  research — a real, sourced strength named directly. Apple Silicon macOS only.
- **Typeless** (`compare/typeless.html`) — `research/03-competitors-indie.md`: widest raw platform
  reach (mac/Win/iOS/Android) with a real Android IME keyboard, but closed source, $12–30/mo, and
  the research's own finding that multiple independent (competitor-adjacent, so hedged
  accordingly) reviews report cloud-only processing despite marketing that reads as local.
- **Raycast Dictation** (`compare/raycast.html`) — `research/02-competitors-desktop.md`: named in
  the primary-source thread as where a user switched *away* from Wispr Flow to. Cloud-only, no
  named model/subprocessor, free during an unpriced beta, no Android.
- **Amical** (`compare/amical.html`) — `research/03-competitors-indie.md` + `08-open-questions.md`
  #3: the most direct Android competitor and genuinely MIT/on-Google-Play, built specifically
  around the honest "undisclosed" framing described above rather than skipped outright.

**Not built, and why** (still excluded after the Batch 2 pass):
- **Srota** — only a single mention in the primary-source thread, and the research itself
  (`research/03-competitors-indie.md` "Brand risk 2") frames it mainly as a tagline/positioning
  collision with a one-person, unincorporated project, not a feature-comparable product. Building
  a comparison page here would mirror the same bad-faith-appearance problem that excluded
  OpenWhispr, at a much smaller scale of relevance. Declined.
- **OpenWhispr** — brand risk, unchanged from Batch 1's reasoning above.
- **Cactus** — not an end-user dictation app (an inference runtime/SDK); nothing to compare
  head-to-head against a dictation product. Also flagged `NOASSERTION` license in research, adding
  a second reason to leave it alone.
- **heyclicky** — `research/03-competitors-indie.md` says outright "not really a competitor"
  (a screen-aware assistant with dictation as one line item). Declined on the research's own say-so.

### 2. Long-tail / use-case pages

`/android/{slug}.html` for Android-specific guides, `/use-cases/{slug}.html` for angles that apply
to both platforms or target a specific audience (introduced in Batch 2, see below).

**Batch 1:** `On-device Whisper dictation for Android` and `Free, open-source voice dictation app`.
These target the two structural gaps the research keeps surfacing:
- `research/03-competitors-indie.md`: "Android has two competitors, and neither clearly claims
  free + open-source + genuinely on-device." That's a specific, defensible long-tail claim
  ("one of the few genuinely on-device, open-source dictation apps on Android" — phrased as "one
  of the few," not "the only," because Amical's architecture is unverified).
- `research/04-pain-points.md`: the free/open-source framing draws 20–100x the engagement of the
  privacy framing in organic discussion (143–591 points vs 2–8). So the long-tail pages lead with
  free + offline + no-account, matching `research/07-recommendations.md`'s explicit positioning
  guidance ("Lead with free and offline. Privacy is the closer, not the opener").

**Batch 2 (3 new, under `/use-cases/`):**
- **One free, open-source app for macOS and Android** (`use-cases/mac-and-android-dictation.html`)
  — `research/02` + `03`: the desktop cluster (Handy, FluidVoice, VoiceInk, Muesli) ships no
  Android at all; the Android cluster (Typeless, Amical) is closed-source/cloud-uncertain. OpenWispr
  is the one project genuinely straddling both with the same license and architecture — a real,
  structural claim, not a keyword swap of an existing page.
- **Multilingual dictation without unwanted translation**
  (`use-cases/multilingual-dictation.html`) — `research/04-pain-points.md` #8, "two flanks nobody
  is contesting": two separate, dated, organic user reports of Wispr Flow spontaneously
  translating instead of transcribing. Written with explicit hedging — it makes a structural
  argument about OpenWispr's architecture (no network round-trip to swap models mid-session), not
  an untested claim that OpenWispr has been benchmarked against this exact failure mode.
- **Dictation software with no server to send your keystrokes to**
  (`use-cases/dictation-it-wont-block.html`) — `research/04-pain-points.md` #6: a dated, organic
  report of a real corporate IT department banning Wispr Flow outright over keyboard/screen access
  concerns, plus Wispr's own documented Context Awareness data-collection scope. A distinct
  audience (IT/security reviewers) and a distinct argument (architecture vs. policy) from the
  existing free/open-source and on-device pages — not a rewrite of either.

**Declined for Batch 2, and why** (so the user knows what's still missing rather than assuming
coverage):
- **Generic "on-device Mac dictation" page.** `research/03-competitors-indie.md`'s own bottom
  line: "macOS is saturated… 'Another free on-device Mac dictation app' is a losing frame." Building
  this would contradict the research's own explicit recommendation, so it wasn't built. The
  cross-platform use-case page above is the differentiated version of this angle that *is*
  defensible.
- **"OpenWispr never loses your dictation" / crash-recovery angle.** This is real demand
  (`research/04-pain-points.md` #2, `research/07-recommendations.md`'s reliability pattern) and
  would be a strong page — but `research/07-recommendations.md`'s own competitive table lists
  OpenWispr as "No" on audio-kept / row-on-failure / retry-UI / crash-recovery **today**, and the
  fix is tracked as in-progress on a separate branch (`never-lose-audio`), not merged into what
  this worktree builds from. Claiming this feature now would misrepresent the current app. Declined
  until the fix ships; the existing comparison pages already hedge this honestly ("actively in
  development") rather than pretending otherwise.
- **Accessibility (VoiceOver/TalkBack) angle.** `research/07-recommendations.md` flags this as a
  real open flank nobody is contesting, and Handy proves the frame works — but no research doc
  documents OpenWispr's own current VoiceOver/TalkBack support level to make a truthful,
  specific claim about it. Declined for lack of a sourceable claim about OpenWispr itself, not
  for lack of demand.
- **Coding/terminal dictation workflow angle.** No research doc quantifies organic demand for this
  specific query shape (Wispr's Context Awareness sending code variable names is a privacy point,
  not a demand signal for a dedicated "dictation while coding" page). Declined for insufficient
  sourced demand.
- **Windows on-device dictation page.** OpenWispr's Windows build is marked "in progress," not
  shipped — a page targeting a platform-specific query for a platform that doesn't exist yet would
  be premature. Declined until Windows ships.

### 3. Journal pages (`/journal/{slug}.html`) — batch 3, new content type

**What these are, and why the URL/type is separate from `/use-cases/`.** "How I use OpenWispr in
my workflow" pieces — first-person narrative pages that walk through a real usage pattern and
surface specific app features along the way, rather than reading as a spec sheet. Given a new
top-level type (`journal`, not folded into `longtail`) and its own `/journal/` path, distinct from
`/use-cases/` and `/android/`, for one deliberate reason: this content makes a first-person voice
claim ("we/us", not "you might find") that no other page type on this site makes, and it needed a
disclosure guarantee (see below) that shouldn't silently apply to, or be silently skipped by,
other longtail-shaped pages. Keeping it a distinct `type` in `build.mjs`'s `RENDERERS` map means a
future contributor can't add a testimonial-shaped page under `longtail` by accident and skip the
disclosure step.

**The non-negotiable constraint this batch was built under: no fabricated persona.** A "workflow"
content type is an obvious place to slip into writing a fake customer testimonial — "Sarah, a
product manager, says…" — which is exactly the kind of invented-claim content the quality bar
above already rejects for comparison pages, just in a different shape. So every journal page is
framed as **the OpenWispr project's own** first-person account (how the people building OpenWispr
use it themselves, e.g. to write their own commit messages), not a fictional user, company, or job
title. This is enforced structurally, not just by editorial care: `render.mjs`'s `journalNoteHtml()`
renders a fixed disclosure strip — "This is a first-person account from the people building
OpenWispr... not a customer testimonial, and not a fictional user" — immediately under the
breadcrumb on every journal page, before any narrative content, with identical wording each time
(a data file cannot opt out of it or rephrase it away).

**Every feature claim traces to the actual Android/macOS source, not a marketing assumption.**
Verified directly against code before writing, not assumed from `docs/personalization.md` alone:

- **Personal vocabulary / auto-learning** — `VocabRepository.kt`'s `learnFromEdit` (up to 5
  position-aligned corrections per edit, deliberately conservative), and
  `textproc/VocabCorrector.kt`'s fuzzy matching (Soundex phonetic equality + edit-distance score,
  gated more strictly for fuzzy/learned matches than exact ones) plus its `biasPrompt` that feeds
  frequency-ranked corrected terms back into the on-device STT decoder.
- **Tone-by-app** — `AppToneRepository.kt` + `textproc/AppContext.kt`: a `Category` enum
  (generic/code/email/chat/social/notes) with per-category default LLM-polish tone fragments
  (professional for email, casual for chat/social; empty for code and notes). Important nuance
  actually reflected in the copy: `Category.CODE`'s tone fragment is empty because code/terminal
  text is instead handled by a *separate, deterministic* path (`textproc/CodeContext.kt`), not by
  an LLM tone override — the journal copy states this distinction rather than flattening it into
  "code mode gets a terse tone."
- **Code/terminal-aware formatting** — `textproc/CodeContext.kt`: dedicated code editors are
  always code-mode; terminals are decided *by the content of that utterance* (word count ≤10,
  starts with a known command verb/path/CLI flag), because the file's own doc comment records
  that ~70% of real terminal dictation turned out to be natural-language AI-agent prompts, not
  shell commands. The journal piece uses this exact reasoning, not an invented one.
- **Never-lose-audio / write-ahead store + retry** — `PendingAudio.kt`'s class doc (the RAM-only
  failure this was built to prevent), its write-ahead-to-`filesDir`-before-first-attempt
  guarantee, `inFlight` as in-memory-only "running" state, and `unfinished()`/`expired()` retention
  rules; `RewriteActivity.kt`'s retry path, which explicitly prefers a different STT engine on
  retry since a transcription failure is often deterministic. This feature was flagged **declined,
  not yet shipped** in Batch 2's punch list (tracked then on the `never-lose-audio` branch); it has
  since merged into `main` (commit `c4a2df7`, "Never lose the audio when a dictation fails (#25)"),
  so it's now a truthful claim about the shipped app rather than the misrepresentation Batch 2
  correctly avoided.
- **Personalization layers L1–L4** — `docs/personalization.md` (the map used to scope the second
  article), cross-checked against `CorrectionCorpus.kt` (ring-capped 500-entry on-device log of
  `{cleaned, final, edited}`), the few-shot retrieval in `CorrectionCorpus.similar`/`score` (token-
  Jaccard, `MIN_JACCARD = 0.2`, boosted for same app-context/edited rows — explicitly *not* dense
  RAG, and the copy says so), `Settings.kt`'s `PolishLevel` enum (`OFF`/`LIGHT`/`MEDIUM`/`FULL`,
  few-shot examples only injected at Medium/Full), and `CorrectionCorpus.exportJsonl` for the L4
  export path (explicit user action, training happens in the separate `openwispr-finetune` repo,
  never automatic upload).
- **On-device STT (Parakeet default, Whisper alternative)** — `OnDeviceStt.kt`: `"local"`
  provider's default model resolves to Parakeet (`ParakeetModelManager.MODEL_ID`); Whisper
  (tiny/base/small, `WhisperModelManager`) is the alternative on-device engine. Matches
  `llms.txt`'s existing "NVIDIA Parakeet-TDT (default) or Whisper" framing, not a new claim.
- **macOS parity, checked, not assumed** — before writing "we" without hedging, confirmed the
  Android features named above have real macOS equivalents in the same repo:
  `macos/OpenWisprCore/Sources/OpenWisprCore/VocabCorrector.swift`, `CorrectionCorpus.swift`, and
  `AppContext.swift`, plus `macos/App/Sources/PendingAudioStore.swift` and `StyleMemoryView.swift`.
  The journal copy speaks about the app in general rather than calling out one platform's file
  names, which is accurate given this parity — it would not have been accurate to write "we" if
  the feature only existed on one platform.

**Declined for lack of verification — named explicitly so nothing here is silently assumed:**
- **A specific quantified claim about how much time dictation actually saves per commit/PR.** No
  file in the repo or `research/` measures this; the articles describe the workflow and the
  mechanism, not a fabricated time-savings number.
- **IDE plugin / editor extension integration.** No such integration exists in the Android or
  macOS source — `CodeContext.kt`'s "dedicated code editors" list is a *package-name detection*
  list (the app runs alongside those apps as any Android/macOS IME/accessibility-style dictation
  tool would), not a plugin architecture. The articles do not claim one.
  Fair reading was verified: `CodeContext.kt` recognizes editor package names to switch
  normalization mode; it is not itself a VS Code/JetBrains extension.
- **A specific named example of a real commit message this repo shipped via dictation.** True in
  substance (a fair amount of this project's own commit history was dictated) but no commit is
  tagged or logged as dictated vs. typed, so no specific commit SHA is cited as evidence — the
  claim is kept at the level the record actually supports.
- **Windows.** Same reasoning as Batch 2: not shipped, so no journal-page claim assumes it.

Two articles shipped this batch, both new pages (no existing page renamed or restructured):
1. `journal/dictating-code-and-commits.json` → `/journal/dictating-code-and-commits.html` — a
   coding/technical workflow piece (commit messages, PR descriptions), grounding personal
   dictionary, tone-by-app/code-aware formatting, and never-lose-audio.
2. `journal/why-we-never-lose-your-audio.json` → `/journal/why-we-never-lose-your-audio.html` — a
   reflective piece on why the write-ahead audio store and engine-switching retry were built the
   way they were, then walking through personalization layers L1–L4 as the same principle applied
   one layer up.

Both are linked from `index.html`'s `#compare` section (a new "From the project journal:" row,
additive, placed after the existing "Guides:" row so it doesn't disturb prior links), from each
other via `relatedLinks`, and from `llms.txt`'s new "Journal" section — so neither is an orphan
page, consistent with the internal-linking rule in the quality bar below.

### Batch 5 — the platform question, and device fit

Two new long-tail pages, both under `/android/`, plus the Markdown-mirror infrastructure below.
The source for this batch is `research/11-yaps.md` (2026-09-03), but note *what* was taken from
it: not the competitor, the market fact the competitor surfaced. Every claim on the Gboard page
was then re-verified against Google's own help pages and the original TechCrunch report on
2026-09-07, because the research doc found those facts *quoted on a competitor's blog*, and
`00-method.md`'s source hierarchy puts competitor marketing at the bottom and excludes it as
evidence. A competitor's page is a lead, never a citation.

- **`/android/gboard-rambler-voice-typing.html`** — Google shipped Gemini-powered dictation into
  Gboard (Rambler, announced 2026-05-12 at Android Show: I/O Edition). This is the single biggest
  competitive fact on Android and it is not a startup. The page exists because Google's own
  documentation contains the qualifier the launch coverage didn't: as of 2026-09-07 the
  [Rambler help page](https://support.google.com/gboard/answer/17468539) lists **"Pixel 11 series
  devices"** under Prerequisites, plus "an active internet connection for full features of
  Rambler. Offline is supported but with limited features." TechCrunch reported in May that the
  rollout would cover "Samsung Galaxy and Google Pixel phones" initially and widen; four months
  later Google's docs name one family. The page also uses Google's documented offline behaviour
  (basic cleanup/punctuation/capitalisation only), its privacy wording ("temporarily processed by
  Google… deleted immediately after your text is delivered"), its stated usage limits, and the
  separate [advanced voice typing](https://support.google.com/gboard/answer/11197787) tier
  (Pixel 6+, on-device except "Fix it", which is itself Pixel 8+/English/US/online).
  Clears the bar: real query demand (people search whether Rambler works on their phone), a
  materially different argument from every existing page, and it is genuinely useful to a Pixel
  owner — it opens by telling them to use Rambler instead.
- **`/android/will-on-device-dictation-run-on-my-phone.html`** — the requirements question no
  on-device dictation app answers honestly, written from OpenWispr's own shipped behaviour rather
  than from research: `DeviceFit.kt` reads total RAM, Android's low-RAM flag, and free storage on
  first run and picks one of three real model pairs (~1GB / ~383MB / ~316MB). Every number on the
  page traces to `WhisperModelManager.MODELS`, `ParakeetModelManager.SIZE_LABEL`,
  `LlmModelManager.MODELS`, and `DeviceFitTest`. The page states the accuracy cost of the smaller
  tiers plainly, per quality-bar rule #3.

**Declined this batch: `/compare/yaps.html`.** Yaps is the most directly comparable competitor
found so far — an on-device Android *keyboard*, five platforms, the same model architecture — and
`research/11-yaps.md` is well sourced enough to write the page. It was still declined, on the
pipeline's own demand rule: 1,878 Android installs and zero organic press means there is no
meaningful search volume behind "yaps alternative" to land on. Publishing it would be a page
built for a query nobody types, and its most quotable facts (a 2.2★ average, a public paywall
reversal) would make it read as a hit piece rather than a comparison. Revisit only if they grow.
The genuinely useful thing in that research — the Android keyboard-vs-overlay argument — needs a
page of its own written around the tradeoff honestly, not a competitor scoreboard; not built yet.

### Markdown mirrors (batch 5 infrastructure)

Every generated page now also writes a `.md` twin at the same path (`/compare/handy.html` →
`/compare/handy.md`), plus one for the hand-written `privacy.html`. `lib/markdown.mjs` renders
them from the same `data/*.json` the HTML comes from, so they cannot drift; `server.js` serves
`.md` as `text/markdown` with the same `no-cache` policy as HTML, since a mirror is a page rather
than an asset.

They are deliberately **not** in `sitemap.xml` — an alternate representation of a URL, not a
second URL competing for the same query — and each carries a `canonical` front-matter field
pointing at its `.html` twin. `llms.txt` documents the convention, since that is where an
assistant looks. The home page is not mirrored: it is a visual landing page whose text is mostly
widget labels, and `llms.txt` already serves as its plain-text form. `staticPageMarkdown()`
throws rather than writing an empty file if `privacy.html`'s markup ever stops matching its
assumptions, so a redesign fails the build instead of silently publishing a blank privacy policy.

### What's explicitly NOT built (spam-policy discipline)

Google's Scaled Content Abuse policy (cited directly in the AutoMata handover,
`05-what-doesnt.md` #1) targets exactly the pattern this plan avoids: publishing pages against a
template with no distinct value per page. Concretely, **not building**:
- A per-city or per-profession grid ("dictation for lawyers", "dictation for nurses", ×50) — no
  factual basis per cell exists in `research/`, so every page would be interchangeable filler. This
  holds even under the Batch 2 volume-first decision above — volume came from real breadth of
  angles already in `research/`, never from templating one angle across a fake variable.
- A comparison page for every name that appears anywhere in `research/` regardless of source
  quality — Srota, OpenWhispr, Cactus, and heyclicky were all considered for Batch 2 and declined
  for specific, stated reasons above; a comparison page making claims from an explicitly
  `⚠️ Unverified` research section would be asserting things the research itself doesn't stand
  behind.
- Auto-generated FAQ blocks with LLM-invented "common questions" not grounded in the pain-point
  research. Every FAQ on every generated page below traces to a specific claim in `research/`.

The rule this plan holds itself to, adapted from `04-what-works.md`'s SellBikes.in lesson: **a
new page must answer a query with demand AND say something the existing pages don't** — not just
exist to grow a sitemap count.

```

21 data files → 21 generated pages as of Batch 5 (4 from Batch 1, 12 from Batch 2, 2 from Batch 3,
1 from Batch 4 — `compare-wispr-flow.json` was edited in place, not added — and 2 from Batch 5),
plus the 2 hand-written pages (`index.html`, `privacy.html`) = **23 pages live on the site**, each
generated page also served as a `.md` mirror.

Run it with:

```bash
cd website/pseo
node build.mjs
```

Zero npm dependencies — `build.mjs` and `render.mjs` use only `node:fs`, `node:path`, and
template literals. This matches the constraint that the *deployed* site stays
zero-dependency; there's no need for a dev-only dependency here either since the templating is
simple string assembly, not a real templating language.

**Data-driven, not hand-edited HTML.** Every fact-bearing string (competitor pricing, a quoted
review, a feature-parity claim) lives in the JSON data file with a `source` field pointing at the
`research/*.md` file and section it came from. `render.mjs` never invents copy — it only lays out
what the data file provides. This makes two things possible later: (1) a human/LLM content pass
can regenerate `data/*.json` from a fresh research pull without touching template code, and (2)
the harness described in the punch list below can eventually validate that every claim shipped
still has a `source` field before allowing a merge, mirroring the AutoMata harness's schema-level
safety gates (`docs/ai-seo-handover/03-harness-architecture.md`, `types.ts`).

**Design-system fidelity.** `render.mjs`'s color tokens, font stack, border-radius, and shadow
values are copied directly from `website/index.html`'s inline `oklch(...)` values (warm
cream/orange palette, Mulish + IBM Plex Mono, pill-shaped nav, card-with-1px-border pattern) so
generated pages render as native site pages, not a bolted-on template. The comparison table reuses
the exact grid/row structure from index.html's `#compare` section; the FAQ accordion reuses the
same `data-faq` / `data-faq-answer` / `data-faq-icon` JS pattern already shipping in
`index.html`'s inline `<script>` block.

**Output paths and internal linking.** Pages are flat `.html` files (`/compare/wispr-flow.html`,
not `/compare/wispr-flow/`) because `server.js` does not perform directory-index resolution below
`/` — it only special-cases the root path. Every generated page links back to `/` and to 2–3
sibling generated pages via its own `relatedLinks` (rendered as a "keep reading" footer block), and
`index.html`'s `#compare` section now links to all 11 comparison pages plus a new "Guides:" row
linking to all 5 long-tail/use-case pages (Batch 2 added `/use-cases/{slug}.html` links there
specifically because those pages have no other natural inbound link the way `/android/` guides get
picked up by comparison-page `relatedLinks`). This keeps every generated page reachable by an
internal link, which matters because the AutoMata orphan-pages analyzer
(`docs/ai-seo-handover/02-analyzers.md` #3) found that a page with zero inbound internal links gets
essentially no crawl-authority signal regardless of content quality.

**Sitemap.** `build.mjs` also (re)writes `website/sitemap.xml` covering `/`, `/privacy.html`, and
every generated page, plus a `website/robots.txt` pointing at it. Neither existed before this
change. This is required infrastructure for the orphan-pages analyzer in the punch list, and for
IndexNow once wired.

## Spam-policy / quality bar (explicit, not implied)

Every generated page must satisfy all of the following before it ships. This is the "quality gate"
the AutoMata build has as an automated score threshold (`weekly-seo-improvement.yml`, revert if
score < 70); here it's a manual checklist because there's no analyzer yet to automate it:

1. **Traces to research.** Every factual claim about a competitor has a `source` pointer into
   `research/*.md`. No claim sourced only from an `⚠️ Unverified` line in that research ships as a
   stated fact — it's either omitted or explicitly hedged in the copy.
2. **Not a template stamp.** The page says something the other generated pages don't. If two pages
   would be >60% identical prose with find-replaced nouns, don't ship the second one — that's
   exactly the "scaled content abuse" pattern.
3. **Genuinely useful if a competitor's own user landed on it.** The comparison pages state where
   OpenWispr is *worse* or *unproven* (e.g., 0 GitHub stars vs Wispr Flow's user base, no iOS,
   younger project) — not just a one-sided pitch. Research-backed criticism of OpenWispr itself
   (from `research/07-recommendations.md`'s "OpenWispr (today)" row showing "No" on audio
   retention/retry) is not hidden.
4. **One canonical URL per topic**, `<link rel="canonical">` self-referencing, no near-duplicate
   slugs for the same query.
5. **Internally linked** from at least one other page (see above) — no orphans.

## Punch list — what's stubbed pending API keys / infra

None of this blocks the pages already shipped; it's the natural next phase once the user adds
keys, following `docs/ai-seo-handover/01-setup-checklist.md`'s bring-up order.

- **Google Search Console.** No property is verified yet for `openwispr.dev`. Needed before any
  of the analyzers below can run. ~15 min per the handover checklist (DNS TXT verification).
- **GSC service account + `scripts/lib/gsc-client.ts`.** Not copied over — no credentials to test
  it against yet. When ready, copy from
  `~/Documents/Personal/AutoMata/astro-news/scripts/lib/gsc-client.ts` verbatim per
  `docs/ai-seo-handover/07-reusable-code.md`.
- **`ctr-audit.ts` / `topic-opportunities.ts` analyzers.** Meaningless with zero GSC history.
  Per the setup checklist, don't even attempt the CTR audit below ~60 days of impressions data —
  copy these over once that data exists, not before.
- **Topic-opportunities-driven page ideas.** The next batch of long-tail pages should ideally come
  from `topic-opportunities.ts` output (queries OpenWispr already ranks pos 10–80 for with no
  dedicated page) rather than more hand-guessing from `research/`. Requires GSC first.
- **LLM-assisted content generation at scale.** This first batch was written by hand from
  `research/` sources for factual precision. A `content-writer`-style provider abstraction
  (`docs/ai-seo-handover/07-reusable-code.md`'s `lib/providers/{anthropic,google,openai,base}.ts`)
  could scale a *second* batch once GSC identifies real query demand — but per `05-what-doesnt.md`
  lesson #1, do not scale page count ahead of measured demand. Needs `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` and/or
  `GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY`; wire as env vars, never hardcoded.
- **IndexNow.** No key generated, no `scripts/indexnow-ping.ts`. Trivial to add later
  (`openssl rand -hex 16`, drop `public/{key}.txt` — here that's `website/{key}.txt`, since
  `server.js` serves the whole `website/` dir as the root) — but pointless to wire before there
  are enough pages shipping regularly to justify a ping script. Follow `/seo-indexnow-wire`.
  Explicitly: **do not reuse any key from the AutoMata/SellBikes.in repo** — it's a distinct
  ownership signature per host.
  Note: IndexNow only covers Bing/Yandex/Brave/Seznam — Google needs GSC's own crawl regardless.
- **The weekly autonomous harness (`scripts/agent/*`, title-rewrite action).** Not applicable yet
  — there's no CTR audit to feed it and, per `seo-harness-deploy`'s own precondition, it shouldn't
  be deployed before 4+ successful *manual* CTR-improvement cycles have shipped once GSC data
  exists. Revisit after the first 60–90 days of traffic.
- **`data/experiments/ledger.jsonl`.** Not created — nothing has shipped that needs the recency
  filter yet. When the harness is eventually stood up, backfill one row per page in this pSEO
  batch (`action_type: "pseo-page-add"`, `commit_sha` from git log) so day-one recency filtering
  isn't toothless (`05-what-doesnt.md` #3).
- **Batch 2 status (this pass).** Amical, VoiceInk, and Handy — the three candidates this list
  previously deferred — are now built; see "Comparison pages, batch 2" above for how each cleared
  the bar (Amical via honest hedging of the one open question, not by resolving it). The remaining
  deferred items are listed there too, under "Not built, and why" and "Declined for Batch 2."
- **Next comparison-page candidates for a future batch**, still not built: none of the currently
  known competitors clear the bar without a research update. A next pass should first re-run
  `research/08-open-questions.md` #1–3 (Android demand sizing, the Gboard comparison, and
  Amical's on-device status) rather than reach for more competitor names — per `05-what-doesnt.md`
  lesson #1, breadth should keep coming from genuine research findings, not from working down an
  ever-longer competitor list once the well-documented ones are exhausted.
- **Batch 3+ volume decision needs revisiting once GSC exists.** The user's page-volume-first call
  in "Batch 2" above was explicitly scoped to "the first few weeks" of a brand-new site with no
  Search Console history. Once GSC data exists, prefer `topic-opportunities.ts`-driven page ideas
  (see above) over more hand-guessed breadth from `research/` — the volume-first mode was a
  cold-start strategy, not the intended steady state.
- **Batch 3 status (this pass).** Added the `journal` page type and its first 2 pages — see
  "Journal pages (`/journal/{slug}.html`) — batch 3" above for the full grounding writeup. Notably,
  this pass also confirmed the never-lose-audio feature, declined for a page claim in Batch 2's
  punch list because it was still in-progress on a branch, has since merged to `main` (commit
  `c4a2df7`) — so it's now fair game for future comparison-page and use-case-page updates too, not
  just the journal pages built this round. A logical next step for a future batch: revisit the
  Batch 2 comparison pages that hedged "actively in development" on audio retention/retry and
  update that language now that it has shipped — not done in this pass because it's out of scope
  for "add a new content type," but flagged here so it isn't lost.
- **Batch 4 status (this pass).** Added the Wispr Flow alternative pages — see "Batch 4" above.
  Also caught a real freshness bug before shipping: the research this batch draws on
  (`research/04-pain-points.md`, `08-open-questions.md`) is an explicit 2026-07-28 snapshot that
  flags Wispr Flow's Android "limited time only" free-tier notice and Play Store rating as
  time-sensitive, with a note to re-verify before acting on either. Live-checked both before
  merging: the "limited time only" wording is already gone from Wispr Flow's pricing page. Every
  occurrence of both claims was reworded to explicit past-tense, dated statements rather than
  presenting July data as current fact — a concrete example of why the re-verify note in
  `08-open-questions.md` exists, and a reminder to actually do it before shipping any batch that
  touches a time-sensitive competitor claim.
- **Journal page type — future candidates, not built this round.** Only 2 journal pages shipped,
  matching the task's ask. Other workflow angles that would need their own research/verification
  pass before writing (not built now, listed so nothing is silently assumed covered): a
  macOS-specific workflow piece (e.g. using the menu-bar app during a long writing session); an
  accessibility-angle journal piece (declined for the same reason as Batch 2's accessibility
  use-case page — no sourced claim yet about OpenWispr's own VoiceOver/TalkBack support level).
