/// exactly what `AudioCapture` produces and what sherpa's feature front-end expects, so no
/// resampling/conversion is needed.
///
/// Parakeet is sub-second on Apple Silicon and matches whisper-small accuracy, with strong
/// inverse text normalization (numbers, money, dates rendered as digits). It has no
/// `initial_prompt`-style biasing hook in the greedy path, so the personal-vocab `bias` terms
/// are applied downstream by the deterministic vocab corrector rather than here.
///
/// The recognizer isn't guaranteed thread-safe, so all decode calls are funnelled through a
/// dedicated `actor` (`Engine`). The heavy graph load happens lazily on the first transcribe and
/// the recognizer is kept warm for subsequent takes.
///
/// Lives in the app target (not `OpenWisprCore`) because it links the native xcframework, which
/// only resolves under an Xcode build — `OpenWisprCore`'s `swift test` stays pure Foundation.
